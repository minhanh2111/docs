#### **Packaged Software like Base, Misa, 1Office / Phần Mềm Đóng Gói Như Base, Misa, 1Office**

- Each function is a separate app/module with its own data structure and business logic isolated and rigid.
- Impossible to create a universal automation layer that can connect, interact, and process these objects seamlessly.
- Automation itself is also a standalone module, only capable of executing a limited set of predefined business actions. Since it connects to isolated apps, failure rates are higher.
- No built-in support for deep low-code customization or integration with external systems.

#### **Luklak Universal Automation**

- Built on the core logic of Universal Object, the foundation of all functions in Luklak's Nocode & Lowcode architecture.
- Enables seamless, universal automation across all functional data created from Universal Objects.
- Automation actions are deeply integrated by design, and every functional dataset automatically inherits these powerful capabilities.
- Combines native low-code power within Luklak with the ability to connect to N8n for additional Javascript/Python scripting to handle advanced scenarios.
